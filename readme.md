# Introduction
This is my solution the assessment required for the job of a [backend developer](https://gist.github.com/the17thstudio/22a3339a46f5ac1d322633482eed32a0).

# ATTENTION
According to the instruction, [this project](https://github.com/Resilience-17-Labs/assessment-profold) should be use as scaffold but I do not use appcorejs for backend development so I used expressjs.
